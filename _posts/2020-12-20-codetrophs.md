description: During this internship, I worked with a team of four interns to predict the flare of a research paper. For example, if a research paper belong to the domain of networking, then using the content of the paper, our AI model should assign the tag 'Networking' to our paper. I worked on finding a dataset of publicly available research papers using Web Scraping. We targeted a University and downloaded all the papers belonging to various categories. Using title, keywords and abstract as the features, a text-based model was built to classify a paper into its categories.
