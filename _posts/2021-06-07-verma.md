description: During this internship, I worked with a group of three interns to detect forgery and fraud in all data  formats like text, image and video. First, we focused on image forgery detection. We tried two approaches - one using Deep Learning and other using block comparison. I also worked on developing a Django applications for the model and finally converted it to an API.
