description: During this internship, I went through some basic trainings in Linux, Git, Bitbucket, Jira, and Visual Studio Code. Additionally, I went through Splunk and Advanced Splunk Trainings. During all the trainings, I attended teaching sessions and completed hands-on exercises for the day. The exercises were pushed to Bitbucket repository of Nirma University maintained by Crest Data Systems. After completing the trainings, I worked on Network Monitoring App and Add-on for Splunk. The add-on collects events, clients and alerts data and app visualizes it. Visualizations are provided in the form of dashboards. There were four dasboards in total, each for the type of data (events, alerts, clients) and one for troubleshooting. I worked on troubleshooting dashboard that contained charts like last checkpoint, data collected over time and tables like API error details, logs, etc. There were also filters such as timestamp, data type, process ID, etc. In data collection part, I worked on collecting events data. Common classes were developed that was shared between all data types. Data was collected by hitting a given API and written as splunk events by using helper functions such as EventWriter. Some of the special features developed as a part of data collection were checkpointing, account and input, and proxy. Users were able to create accounts, inputs, set up log levels for logging and add and remove proxy.
