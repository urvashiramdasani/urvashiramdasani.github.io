I am Urvashi Ramdasani, a Computer Science and Engineering Graduate from Nirma University, Ahmedabad, Gujarat, India. I love exploring new fields. I always look forward to develop efficient solutions to existing problems. My key areas of interest are Algorithms, Web Development, and Problem Solving. In my free time, I like reading books and watching movies and TV series. Feel free to drop a mail to have a discussion! 

I am always open for collaborations on projects, hackathons and research papers. You can always reach me out and we can work on building something great! Apart from these, I love travelling. You can always find me riding in my car or visiting places during holidays. Currently, I am working at Walmart Global Tech India as Software Development Engineer II.
