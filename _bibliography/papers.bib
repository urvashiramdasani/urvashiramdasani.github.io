  title={Can Quantum-Mechanical Description of Physical Reality Be Considered Complete?},
  author={Einstein, A. and Podolsky, B. and Rosen, N.},
  abstract={In a complete theory there is an element corresponding to each element of reality. A sufficient condition for the reality of a physical quantity is the possibility of predicting it with certainty, without disturbing the system. In quantum mechanics in the case of two physical quantities described by non-commuting operators, the knowledge of one precludes the knowledge of the other. Then either (1) the description of reality given by the wave function in quantum mechanics is not complete or (2) these two quantities cannot have simultaneous reality. Consideration of the problem of making predictions concerning a system on the basis of measurements made on another system that had previously interacted with it leads to the result that if (1) is false then (2) is also false. One is thus led to conclude that the description of reality as given by a wave function is not complete.},

  abstract={The COVID-19 pandemic has adversely affected
  the lives of millions of people worldwide. With an alarming
  increase in COVID-19 cases, it is important to detect and diagnose
  COVID-19 in its early stages to prevent its spread. To diagnose
  remote patients, the Internet can be useful for accessing data of
  that patient. But, the Internet has also had issues related to data
  security, reliability, and privacy. Motivated by these challenges,
  in this paper, we propose a Blockchain (BC) based COVID-
  19 detection scheme (BCovX) for fast and reliable diagnosis
  of COVID-19 using chest X-Ray (CXR) images. For fast and
  accurate detection of COVID-19 using CXR, BCovX consists of
  a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model, using which a
  patient can be diagnosed for COVID-19 remotely. CNNs have
  performed successfully in medical imaging classification. BCovX
  provides reliable and secure data access and exchange using BC
  and smart contracts (SC). To solve issues related to data storage
  and its associated cost, the InterPlanetary File System (IPFS)
  protocol is used to store medical data. We also present a real-time
  SC developed in Solidity to govern the transaction between the
  patient and the doctor. The SC has been compiled and deployed
  on Remix Integrated Development Environment (IDE). Finally,
  we have evaluated the performance of BCovX with traditional
  schemes in terms of storage cost, bandwidth requirements, and
  accuracy of the CNN model.}

  abstract={Machine Learning (ML) is an efficient technology
  for pattern recognition and analysis. Pattern recognition involves
  recognizing patterns from strings, images, etc. Pattern analysis
  and recognition have found great applications in the areas of
  Natural Language Processing, Optical Character Recognition,
  Computer Vision, Autonomous Path Navigation and Speech
  Recognition. Kernel methods are a category of ML algorithms
  extensively used for pattern analysis. These methods use one or
  more kernel functions for analysis. These methods are used in
  specific applications. A variety of kernel functions and methods
  available which have found great use in the areas of medicine,
  information processing, image processing, etc. In this paper,
  a review of kernel functions and methods along with their
  applications has been presented.}
